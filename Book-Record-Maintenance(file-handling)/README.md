## Project Summary
This program simulates a **book record maintenance system** using **file handling** in C.  
It extends the earlier versions (array-based and linked-list-based) by saving all book data in a binary file (`bookrecord.dat`).  

The program provides functionalities for creating, storing, editing, deleting, and displaying book records, ensuring data persists even after the program ends.
