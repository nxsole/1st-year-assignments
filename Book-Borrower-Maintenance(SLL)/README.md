#  Project Summary
This project is a modular program that simulates the **maintenance of book and borrower records** using **singly linked lists**.
It is a conversion of an array-of-structures implementation into a linked-list implementation for more efficient dynamic memory handling.

## The program allows users to:
**Manage Book Records:**

Add a new book record

Search and edit existing records

Search and delete records

Display records by availability, type, author, or all records

**Manage Borrower Records:**

Add a new borrower record

Search and edit borrower details

Search and delete borrowers

Display borrowers by last name or show all borrowers

## Features
Dynamic Data Structures: Implements singly linked lists for both books and borrowers.

Validation: Input checking for valid ranges, duplicates, and errors.

Modularity: Functions are separated for book and borrower operations.

Filtering Options: Ability to filter available books, book type, author, or borrower last names.
